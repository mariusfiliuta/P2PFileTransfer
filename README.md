# P2PFileTransfer
A School Project consisting in an implementation of the peer to peer file transfer. This project is made by creating an client software and an server software. The server software recieves informations from clients of 2 types: either to put the availability of an file to download or request for a file to download from someone. The server stores the IP-s of the clients and ensure when 1 client wants to download a file from another. Clients recieve information about the connection between them and one client becomes the server from whom other will download from.
